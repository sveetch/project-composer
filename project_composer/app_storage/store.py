"""
AppStore is in charge to store application collection, process it to translate
apps as AppNode objects and resolve application order following criterias.

Order criterias are:

* Natural list order which is a soft ordering because it is only respected after other
  criterias;
* Dependency, basically an application occurs after its dependencies;
* Parameter ``push_end`` to push an application after other applications that don't set
  it to True;

Parameter ``push_end`` is the strongest criterias but it does not break the dependency
ordering, so an app follow its dependencies if they are in `push_end`` mode.

Commonly, the `push_end` is to reserve to some very special applications and you
should prefer to lean on natural order and dependency order. If you use it, it is
recommended to use it the less possible because it may prooduces a cascade of
re-ordering you won't be able to fully control.

This is inspired by the algorith from "Ferry Boender":
